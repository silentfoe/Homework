    <p>To be, or not to be: that is the question:
        Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
        The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
        Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
        And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
        No more; and by a sleep to say we end
        The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
        That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
        Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
        To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
        For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
        When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
        Must give us pause: there's the respect
        That makes calamity of so long life;
        For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
        The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
        The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
        The insolence of office and the spurns
        That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
        When he himself might his quietus make
        With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
        To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
        But that the dread of something after death,
        The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
        No traveller returns, puzzles the will
        And makes us rather bear those ills we have
        Than fly to others that we know not of?
        Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
        And thus the native hue of resolution
        Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
        And enterprises of great pith and moment
        With this regard their currents turn awry,
        And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
        The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
        Be all my sins remember'd.
    </p>
    <p>God's bread! it makes me mad:
        Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
        Alone, in company, still my care hath been
        To have her match'd: and having now provided
        A gentleman of noble parentage,
        Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
        Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
        Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
        And then to have a wretched puling fool,
        A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
        To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
        I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
        But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
        Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
        Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
        Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
        An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
        And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
        the streets,
        For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
        Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
        Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
    </p>
